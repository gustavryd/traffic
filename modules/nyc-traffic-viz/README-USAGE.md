## Data Source

This application uses the [NYC Real-Time Traffic Speed Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Real-Time-Traffic-Speed-Data/qkm5-nuaq) from NYC Open Data.

The data includes:
- Current speed on major NYC streets
- Travel time estimates
- Location coordinates for map visualization
- Real-time updates from traffic sensors

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing
If you see "No traffic data available":
1. Check your internet connection (the app needs to access NYC Open Data API)
2. Wait a few seconds for initial data load
3. Check browser console for any error messages
4. The NYC Open Data API may be temporarily unavailable

### Map Not Loading
If the map doesn't appear:
1. Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try refreshing the page
4. The Leaflet map library loads dynamically - give it a few seconds

### CORS/Network Errors
The application makes direct API calls to `data.cityofnewyork.us`. If you see CORS errors:
- This is usually a temporary network/API issue
- The NYC Open Data API should allow cross-origin requests
- Try again in a few minutes

```bash
